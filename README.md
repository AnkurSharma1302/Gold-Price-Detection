# Gold Price Detection
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for detecting and analyzing gold prices. The project utilizes various data analysis techniques to explore and model gold price trends.

## Overview
This repository hosts the Gold Price Detection project, a data analysis and machine learning initiative aimed at understanding and predicting the fluctuations in gold prices. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook that encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
Gold prices are influenced by various economic indicators, market trends, and geopolitical events. This project seeks to uncover patterns in historical gold price data and build models to forecast future prices.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and correlations in gold prices.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features that may help improve model performance.
- Modeling with Random Forest Regressor: Implementing the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to predict future gold prices.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Visualization: Plotting key trends, model predictions, and performance metrics.

## Dependencies
This project is built using the following Python libraries:

- NumPy: Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for predictive data analysis.

## Results
After running the notebook, you will gain insights into:

- Historical trends in gold prices.
- The impact of various economic indicators on gold prices.
- Predictive models, including the Random Forest Regressor, with evaluation metrics.
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual gold prices.
